+TI LMU backlight device tree bindings
+
+Required property:
+ - compatible: Should be one of:
+        "ti,lm3532-backlight"
+        "ti,lm3631-backlight"
+        "ti,lm3632-backlight"
+        "ti,lm3633-backlight"
+        "ti,lm3695-backlight"
+        "ti,lm3697-backlight"
+
+Optional properties:
+ There are two backlight control mode. One is I2C, the other is PWM mode.
+ Following properties are only specified in PWM mode.
+ Please note that LMU backlight device can have only one PWM channel.
+
+ - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification.
+ - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the "pwms"
+              property.
+
+ For the PWM user nodes, please refer to [1].
+
+Child nodes:
+ LMU backlight is represented as sub-nodes of the TI LMU device [2].
+ So, LMU backlight should have more than one backlight child node.
+ Each node exactly matches with backlight control bank configuration.
+ Maximum numbers of child nodes depend on the device.
+
+ 1 = LM3631, LM3632, LM3695
+ 2 = LM3633, LM3697
+ 3 = LM3532
+
+ Required property of a child node:
+ - led-sources: List of enabled channels from 0 to 2.
+                Please refer to LED binding [3].
+                For output channels, please refer to the datasheets [4].
+
+ Optional properties of a child node:
+ - label: Backlight channel identification.
+          Please refer to LED binding [3].
+ - default-brightness-level: Backlight initial brightness value.
+                             Type is <u32>. It is set as soon as backlight
+                             device is created.
+                             0 ~ 2047 = LM3631, LM3632, LM3633, LM3695 and
+                                        LM3697
+                             0 ~ 255  = LM3532
+ - ramp-up-msec, ramp-down-msec: Light dimming effect properties.
+                                 Type is <u32>. Unit is millisecond.
+                                 0 ~ 65 msec    = LM3532
+                                 0 ~ 4000 msec  = LM3631
+                                 0 ~ 16000 msec = LM3633 and LM3697
+ - pwm-period: PWM period. Only valid in PWM brightness mode.
+               Type is <u32>. If this property is missing, then control
+               mode is set to I2C by default.
+
+Examples: Please refer to ti-lmu dt-bindings. [2].
